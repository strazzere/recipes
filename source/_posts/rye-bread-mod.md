Sticking with the OG [low knead crusty bread](https://recipes.strazzere.com/2020/04/19/low-knead-crusty-bread/) and adding some randomness because I had it, and read "5% rye is good" - with no actual photos or reasoning behind it. So, sure, why not try it?

Should yield one, largish, loaf for sandos.

## Ingredients
(dry)
 * 430g white flour
 * 24g rye flour
 * 10g of instant yeast (SAF-Instant is what I've used)
 * 1/2 Tablespoon of coarse sea salt
 * 2 Tablespoons of ["everything but the bagel"](https://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Everything-Sesame-Seasoning/dp/B06W9N8X9H)

(wet)
 * 340g of lukewarm water (105° worked best for me)

## Instructions

(Same as other, repeated here and tweaked just for exact timing I used)

### Ahead Prep
1. Measure incredients seperately, put flour directly KitchenAid
   bowl. Attach mixing blade, turn on. Slowly begin to pour water
   into the bowl. After mostly mixed, scrape the blade with a dough
   scraper, add dough hook, but let the water/flour combination sit
   for 5 minutes.
2. Turn on kitchen aid again with dough hook, one click, begin to add
   salt, then yeast, then "everything but the bagel" seasoning. Let
   mix for ~60 seconds. If needed, scrape sides and/or hook if salt
   or yeast is visible.
3. Stop mixer, remove attachment and cover bowl for a minimum of 2 hours
   and let the dough rise while covered with reynolds wrap.
4. After allowing the dough to rise, place into fridge for a minimum of
   2 hours

### Baking
1. About an hour and a half before you want to have the bread, remove
   dought from fridge, cut approximately half of the dough out and place
   on a floured surface, like parchment paper. Return the rest to the fridge.
   Lightly shape it to whatever shape you'd like, preferably a ball for
   a dutch oven, and dust with flour to retain moisture. Cover with a towl.
   Rest this for a minimum of an hour - but do a touch test to ensure it is
   ready before using. Dash with poppy seeds (didn't really stick? maybe do this before flour)
2. Preheat the oven and cast iron to 450°, this will take approximately ~30
   minutes, so time this to start approximately a half hour after resting the
   dough.
3. After the dough has rested for an hour, take the dutch oven out and plunk
   the dough directly into the dutch oven. No need to grease it or use parchment
   paper. Place cover back in, return dutch oven to the oven, cook for ~25
   minutes with lid on.
4. When the first part of cooking is done, remove the lid, and cook for another
   ~20 minutes depending on what you want the bread to look like.
5. Remove dutch oven and "dump" the bread out, should come out easily, and
   rest it on a rack for a few minutes. Slice, nom, dip in oil/soup/butter.

Not a bad turn out?
