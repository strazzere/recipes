Archiving this recipe even though I've not actually ever made this one. This is from a collection my father sent me when my Grandmother passed away - the collection is titled _Ma's Recipes_. Substitute brands / ingredients as needed, brand names preserved because of memories even though I can't find some of these on the West Coast. Miss you Grandma.
