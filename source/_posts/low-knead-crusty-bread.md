The easiest bread making recipe I've found, somewhat of a mixture of other recipes, but changes slightly to work for me in Oakland, as I work from home, during the COVID-19 issues.

This was basically the thing that was "like sourdough" but not, as I was using instant yeast and didn't want to keep trying to making a sourdough starter.

Gotcha's I found while making this;
 - Know your oven's true temperature. The degrees need to be pretty spot on, if you have cold spots of it's off by 25°, etc - it won't look as good. Get an oven thermometer
 - The dutch oven makes a difference, I couldn't get good shapes/rises/coloring without it, plus it was pretty simple to use, just do it.
 - I've started taking the temperature of the water added, 105° is the target I've been keeping, seems to work best, especially as my kitchen is "cold" (~60°-65°) in comparison to all the books I've read...

 Primarily based off of King Arthur Flour's [No knead Crusty White Bread Recipe](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/no-knead-crusty-white-bread-recipe)

 Below yields 2-3 loaves, though it seems like the perfect amount for 2 good sized loaves in my testing.

 ## Ingredients
(dry)
 * 907g flour
 * 14g of instant yeast (SAF-Instant is what I've used)
 * 1 Tablespoon of coarse sea salt

(wet)
 * 680g of lukewarm water (105° worked best for me)

## Instructions

### Ahead Prep
1. Measure incredients seperately, put flour directly KitchenAid
   bowl. Attach mixing blade, turn on. Slowly begin to pour water
   into the bowl. After mostly mixed, scrape the blade with a dough
   scraper, add dough hook, but let the water/flour combination sit
   for 5 minutes.
2. Turn on kitchen aid again with dough hook, one click, begin to add
   salt, then yeast. Let mix for ~60 seconds. If needed, scrape sides
   and/or hook if salt or yeast is visible.
3. Stop mixer, remove attachment and cover bowl for a minimum of 2 hours
   and let the dough rise while covered with reynolds wrap.
4. After allowing the dough to rise, place into fridge for a minimum of
   2 hours, or leave over night (few days seems fine too).

### Baking
1. About an hour and a half before you want to have the bread, remove
   dought from fridge, cut approximately half of the dough out and place
   on a floured surface, like parchment paper. Return the rest to the fridge.
   Lightly shape it to whatever shape you'd like, preferably a ball for
   a dutch oven, and dust with flour to retain moisture. Cover with a towl.
   Rest this for a minimum of an hour - but do a touch test to ensure it is
   ready before using.
2. Preheat the oven and cast iron to 450°, this will take approximately ~30
   minutes, so time this to start approximately a half hour after resting the
   dough.
3. After the dough has rested for an hour, take the dutch oven out and plunk
   the dough directly into the dutch oven. No need to grease it or use parchment
   paper. Place cover back in, return dutch oven to the oven, cook for ~25-30
   minutes with lid on.
4. When the first part of cooking is done, remove the lid, and cook for another
   ~15-20 minutes depending on what you want the bread to look like.
5. Remove dutch oven and "dump" the bread out, should come out easily, and
   rest it on a rack for a few minutes. Slice, nom, dip in oil/soup/butter.

## Extras / Ideas

* Add rosemary or other dry herbs with the rest of the dry ingredients.
* Just divide the ingredient in half if need be, keep the ratios. Everything in half will
  make one really good loaf

## TODO:
* Picture(s) during next time making them
* Figure out how to add olives/etc similar to Flying Pig bread.
