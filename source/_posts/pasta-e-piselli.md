Similar to the previous recipe - I've not made this in a very long time. Though this is from a collection my father sent me when my Grandmother passed away - the collection is titled _Ma's Recipes_. Substitute brands / ingredients as needed, brand names preserved because of memories even though I can't find some of these on the West Coast. Miss you Grandma.

## Ingredients
 * 1/2 cup olive oil
 * 1 small onion chopped
 * 1 large garlic clove, chopped
 * 1 14oz can Hunts Whole Tomatoes
 * 1 8oz can medium sized sweet peas
 * 1 lb small shells (ditalini or thin spaghetti broken into 1 inch pieces)
 * Small amount of red pepper flakes

## Instructions

1. Heat up olive oil and saute onions until soft, then add garlic.
2. Add canned tomatoes and juice, squeeze tomatoes to break them up, add red pepper flakes.
3. Stir and cook for about 15 minutes on medium heat.
4. Add undrained can of peas, let the sauce simmer. Taste and see if it has enough seasoning, add various spices as needed.
5. Cook for at least 30 minutes.
6. Cook pasta/macaroni separately, drain.


### Serving
Put small macaroni into soup bowls - ladle mixture over pasta. Add grated Parmesan or Romano cheese.

### Other notes from Ma'
I usually put some macaroni in a soup bowl and put the mixture over it.
If the mixture seem too thick you can add a can of chicken broth.
If you like more peas, add another can. Experiment!
