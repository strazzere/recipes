Archiving this recipe even though I've not actually ever made this one. This is from a collection my father sent me when my Grandmother passed away - the collection is titled _Ma's Recipes_. Substitute brands / ingredients as needed, brand names preserved because of memories even though I can't find some of these on the West Coast. Miss you Grandma.

## Ingredients
 * 3 cup zucchini, grated
 * 1 cup Bisquick
 * 1/2 cup chopped onions
 * 1/2 cup grated cheese
 * Dash of pepper
 * 1/2 cup cooking oil
 * 4 or 5 extra large eggs

## Instructions

1. Grease 9x13 inch pan, preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Mix all ingredients, place into pan, cook for 45-60 minutes or until golden brown
3. Slice like brownies -- good cold!
