A few years back I was in Fresno for a volleyball tournament and there was a smoked candied jalapeno condiment at one of the food trucks. Took a photo of the jar so I could look it up online, but somehow never saved the photo. Tried a few other brands, but they always seem too sweet and not hot enough, or just mush. After looking at a bunch of recipes online, it seemed easy enough so I made some while I'm all couped up.

## Ingredients
 * 5 cups of sugar
 * 1 Tablespoon of garlic powder
 * 1/2 Tablespoon of smoked paprika
 * 1/2 Tablespoon of celery seed
 * 1/2 Tablespoon of chipolte
 * 1 1/2 cups of apple cider vinegar
 * 1 1/2 lbs of sliced serrano peppers

## Instructions

1. Mix all the ingredients, except for the peppers in a large pot. Bring
   to a boil, reduce heat and let simmer while you slice the peppers. Toss
   pepper stems.
2. Allow mixture to simmer for at least 6 minutes, occasionally stiring.
3. Add sliced peppers, ensure they're all covered and bring to a slight boil
   for at least 4 minutes. This timing will determine how mushy/firm the peppers
   will be.
3. Remove the peppers with a slotted spoon, fill canning jars, ladel in the sugar
   mixture. Poke things around with a the handle of a spoon to ride air bubbles.
4. Seal jar however you prefer. Keep the extra sugar mixture as it's basically
   a simple syrup infused with serranos.

## TODO

* Try smoking the peppers, might make them too mushy?
* See what the hottest level pepper this would be good for, habaneros/reapers/ghost chilis are likely all too thin for this?
* see how much we can reduce the sugar content and still get the same texture
