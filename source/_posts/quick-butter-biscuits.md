Buttery, soft, quick and easy to make. Might taste a bit "doughy" to some folks. Keeps well for ~3 or 4 days sealing in a container, room temp.

No yeast needed, easy substitutions as well.

## Ingredients
(dry)
 * 2 cups of flour
 * 1 Tablespoon of baking powder
 * 1 Tablespoon of granulated sugar
 * 1 teaspoon of salt

(wet)
 * 6 Tablespoons of cold butter (unsalted)
 * 3/4 cup of whole milk (or ~1 cup of heavy whipping cream, ends up extra dense)

## Instructions
1. Chill butter in freezer for ~30 minutes,
    preheat over to 425°,
    line baking sheet with parchment paper
2. Combine all dry ingredients in bowl
3. Use box grater on butter,
    add to dry ingredients,
    gently combine with spatula/spoon
4. Add milk, gently combine until just barely mixed
5. Transfer to floured surface,
    fold in half with hands and rotate 90°,
    repeat ~5 to 6 times,
    do not over work (will become more dense!)
6. Flatten dough with hand to ~1",
    user mason jar lid to cut out biscuits,
    place on baking sheet
7. Bake for ~12 minutes,
    brush top with melted butter,
    add a dash of Morton's salt to top

## Extras / Ideas

* Add rosemary or other dry herbs with the rest of the dry ingredients.
* Cheddar / Scallions could be a good mix, add immediately before chilled butter probably
* Biscuits tend to look a bit pale, potentially try and egg wash to make them more brown?

## TODO:
* Picture(s) during next time making them
* Test egg wash idea
* Figure out more combinations to add
