Figured it was finally time to post the recipes I always use, lose and somewhat forget online. Since LeeAnn and I are trapped indoors because of COVID-19, now seemed like a good time to start tossing things onto this site.

Maybe it will come in handy for ourselves, someone we don't know, or even out children sometime?
