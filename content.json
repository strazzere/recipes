Should yield one, largish, loaf for sandos. Ingredients(dry) 454g flour 150g whole wheat flour 7g of instant yeast (SAF-Instant is what I’ve used) 1/2 Tablespoon of coarse sea salt (wet) 340g of lukewarm water (105° worked best for me) Instructions(Same as other, repeated here and tweaked just for exact timing I used) Ahead Prep Measure incredients seperately, put flour directly KitchenAidbowl. Attach mixing blade, turn on. Slowly begin to pour waterinto the bowl. After mostly mixed, scrape the blade with a doughscraper, add dough hook, but let the water/flour combination sitfor 5 minutes. Turn on kitchen aid again with dough hook, one click, begin to addsalt, then yeast. Let mix for ~60 seconds. If needed, scrape sidesand/or hook if salt or yeast is visible. Stop mixer, remove attachment and cover bowl for a minimum of 2 hoursand let the dough rise while covered with reynolds wrap. After allowing the dough to rise, place into fridge for a minimum of2 hours Baking About an hour and a half before you want to have the bread, removedought from fridge, cut approximately half of the dough out and placeon a floured surface, like parchment paper. Return the rest to the fridge.Lightly shape it to whatever shape you’d like, preferably a ball fora dutch oven, and dust with flour to retain moisture. Cover with a towl.Rest this for a minimum of an hour - but do a touch test to ensure it isready before using. Dash with poppy seeds (didn’t really stick? maybe do this before flour) Preheat the oven and cast iron to 450°, this will take approximately ~30minutes, so time this to start approximately a half hour after resting thedough. After the dough has rested for an hour, take the dutch oven out and plunkthe dough directly into the dutch oven. No need to grease it or use parchmentpaper. Place cover back in, return dutch oven to the oven, cook for ~25minutes with lid on. When the first part of cooking is done, remove the lid, and cook for another~20 minutes depending on what you want the bread to look like. Remove dutch oven and “dump” the bread out, should come out easily, andrest it on a rack for a few minutes. Slice, nom, dip in oil/soup/butter.

Took a photo of the jar so I could look it up online, but somehow never saved the photo. Tried a few other brands, but they always seem too sweet and not hot enough, or just mush. After looking at a bunch of recipes online, it seemed easy enough so I made some while I’m all couped up. Ingredients 5 cups of sugar 1 Tablespoon of garlic powder 1/2 Tablespoon of smoked paprika 1/2 Tablespoon of celery seed 1/2 Tablespoon of chipolte 1 1/2 cups of apple cider vinegar 1 1/2 lbs of sliced serrano peppers Instructions Mix all the ingredients, except for the peppers in a large pot. Bringto a boil, reduce heat and let simmer while you slice the peppers. Tosspepper stems. Allow mixture to simmer for at least 6 minutes, occasionally stiring. Add sliced peppers, ensure they’re all covered and bring to a slight boilfor at least 4 minutes. This timing will determine how mushy/firm the pepperswill be. Remove the peppers with a slotted spoon, fill canning jars, ladel in the sugarmixture. Poke things around with a the handle of a spoon to ride air bubbles. Seal jar however you prefer. Keep the extra sugar mixture as it’s basicallya simple syrup infused with serranos. TODO Try smoking the peppers, might make them too mushy? See what the hottest level pepper this would be good for, habaneros/reapers/ghost chilis are likely all too thin for this? see how much we can reduce the sugar content and still get the same texture","categories":[{"name":"condiment","slug":"condiment","permalink":"https://recipes.strazzere.com/categories/condiment/"}],"tags":[{"name":"appetizer","slug":"appetizer","permalink":"https://recipes.strazzere.com/tags/appetizer/"},{"name":"spicy","slug":"spicy","permalink":"https://recipes.strazzere.com/tags/spicy/"},{"name":"peppers","slug":"peppers","permalink":"https://recipes.strazzere.com/tags/peppers/"}]},{"title":"low-knead-crusty-bread","slug":"low-knead-crusty-bread","date":"2020-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","updated":"2020-04-30T18:08:11.020Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/04/19/low-knead-crusty-bread/","link":"","permalink":"https://recipes.strazzere.com/2020/04/19/low-knead-crusty-bread/","excerpt":"","text":"The easiest bread making recipe I’ve found, somewhat of a mixture of other recipes, but changes slightly to work for me in Oakland, as I work from home, during the COVID-19 issues. This was basically the thing that was “like sourdough” but not, as I was using instant yeast and didn’t want to keep trying to making a sourdough starter. Gotcha’s I found while making this; Know your oven’s true temperature. The degrees need to be pretty spot on, if you have cold spots of it’s off by 25°, etc - it won’t look as good. Get an oven thermometer The dutch oven makes a difference, I couldn’t get good shapes/rises/coloring without it, plus it was pretty simple to use, just do it. I’ve started taking the temperature of the water added, 105° is the target I’ve been keeping, seems to work best, especially as my kitchen is “cold” (~60°-65°) in comparison to all the books I’ve read… Primarily based off of King Arthur Flour’s No knead Crusty White Bread Recipe Below yields 2-3 loaves, though it seems like the perfect amount for 2 good sized loaves in my testing. Ingredients(dry) 907g flour when making “sandwich bread” I do 807g white flour and 100g rye 14g of instant yeast (SAF-Instant is what I’ve used) 1 Tablespoon of coarse sea salt (wet) 680g of lukewarm water (105° worked best for me) InstructionsAhead Prep Measure incredients seperately, put flour directly KitchenAidbowl.

Extras / Ideas Add rosemary or other dry herbs with the rest of the dry ingredients. Just divide the ingredient in half if need be, keep the ratios.
