Might taste a bit “doughy” to some folks. Keeps well for ~3 or 4 days sealing in a container, room temp. No yeast needed, easy substitutions as well. Ingredients(dry) 2 cups of flour 1 Tablespoon of baking powder 1 Tablespoon of granulated sugar 1 teaspoon of salt (wet) 6 Tablespoons of cold butter (unsalted) 3/4 cup of whole milk (or ~1 cup of heavy whipping cream, ends up extra dense) Instructions Chill butter in freezer for ~30 minutes, preheat over to 425°, line baking sheet with parchment paper Combine all dry ingredients in bowl Use box grater on butter, add to dry ingredients, gently combine with spatula/spoon Add milk, gently combine until just barely mixed Transfer to floured surface, fold in half with hands and rotate 90°, repeat ~5 to 6 times, do not over work (will become more dense!) Flatten dough with hand to ~1”, user mason jar lid to cut out biscuits, place on baking sheet Bake for ~12 minutes, brush top with melted butter, add a dash of Morton’s salt to top Extras / Ideas Add rosemary or other dry herbs with the rest of the dry ingredients. Cheddar / Scallions could be a good mix, add immediately before chilled butter probably Biscuits tend to look a bit pale, potentially try and egg wash to make them more brown? TODO: Picture(s) during next time making them Test egg wash idea Figure out more combinations to add","categories":[{"name":"baking","slug":"baking","permalink":"http://recipes.strazzere.com/categories/baking/"}],"tags":[{"name":"baking","slug":"baking","permalink":"http://recipes.strazzere.com/tags/baking/"},{"name":"no-yeast","slug":"no-yeast","permalink":"http://recipes.strazzere.com/tags/no-yeast/"},{"name":"quick","slug":"quick","permalink":"http://recipes.strazzere.com/tags/quick/"},{"name":"breakfast","slug":"breakfast","permalink":"http://recipes.strazzere.com/tags/breakfast/"},{"name":"dinner","slug":"dinner","permalink":"http://recipes.strazzere.com/tags/dinner/"}]}],"categories":[{"name":"baking","slug":"baking","permalink":"http://recipes.strazzere.com/categories/baking/"}],"tags":[{"name":"baking","slug":"baking","permalink":"http://recipes.strazzere.com/tags/baking/"},{"name":"no-yeast","slug":"no-yeast","permalink":"http://recipes.strazzere.com/tags/no-yeast/"},{"name":"quick","slug":"quick","permalink":"http://recipes.strazzere.com/tags/quick/"},{"name":"breakfast","slug":"breakfast","permalink":"http://recipes.strazzere.com/tags/breakfast/"},{"name":"dinner","slug":"dinner","permalink":"http://recipes.strazzere.com/tags/dinner/"}]}
